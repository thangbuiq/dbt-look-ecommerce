  - name: dim_orders
    description: The dim_orders model is a tool that provides a detailed view of each
      order in a business, including information about discounts, profits, sale prices,
      and product details. It's like a digital ledger, keeping track of all transactions.
      This model can be used to analyze sales trends, identify profitable products,
      and understand customer buying habits. For example, it can show if certain products
      are more profitable due to higher sale prices or lower costs, or if certain
      departments are offering more discounts. This information can help in making
      strategic business decisions.
